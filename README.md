# EFCA-ADAPT-AG: Advanced AGI Meta-Reinforcement Learning Agent

## Overview

EFCA-ADAPT-AG is a cutting-edge meta-reinforcement learning system designed for adaptive general intelligence applications. This project combines state-of-the-art techniques including Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and curiosity-driven exploration to create a robust, scalable, and service-oriented architecture for adaptive AI agents.

The system is built to handle complex, dynamic environments where rapid adaptation and continuous learning are essential. It features a modular design that supports both research experimentation and production deployment.

## Key Features

- **Meta-Learning Framework**: Implements MAML for rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal samples
- **Advanced Policy Optimization**: Integrates PPO for stable and efficient policy learning
- **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**: Employs intrinsic motivation mechanisms to encourage exploration in sparse reward environments
- **Scalable Architecture**: Service-oriented design supporting distributed training and deployment
- **Modular Components**: Easily extensible framework for experimenting with different RL algorithms
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Compatible with various simulation environments and real-world applications
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in monitoring and visualization tools for training insights
- **Production-Ready**: Designed for both research and production use cases

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for training)
- pip or conda package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunghunkwag/efca-adapt-ag.git
cd efca-adapt-ag
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Training

To start training an agent with default configuration:

```bash
python ai_studio_code.py --mode train --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python ai_studio_code.py --mode eval --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.pth
```

### Custom Configuration

Modify configuration files or pass parameters directly:

```bash
python ai_studio_code.py --mode train --learning-rate 0.001 --batch-size 64
```

## Configuration

The system supports various configuration options:

- **Learning Rate**: Controls the optimization step size
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples per training iteration
- **Meta-Learning Parameters**: Inner/outer loop settings for MAML
- **PPO Hyperparameters**: Clip range, entropy coefficient, value loss coefficient
- **Curiosity Module**: Intrinsic reward scaling and network architecture
- **Environment Settings**: Task distribution, episode length, reward structure

Refer to the configuration files for detailed parameter descriptions.

## Algorithms

### MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)
Enables rapid adaptation to new tasks by learning an initialization that can be quickly fine-tuned with few gradient steps.

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
Provides stable policy updates through clipped objective functions, balancing exploration and exploitation.

### Curiosity-Driven Learning
Augments extrinsic rewards with intrinsic motivation based on prediction error, encouraging exploration of novel states.
